    <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>I was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York. I attended lower and middle school at the Berkeley Carroll School, and went to high school at the Packer Collegiate Institute in Brooklyn Heights. While in high school, I was a student tutor for Spanish and Physics, a teacher's assistant for middle school science courses, and part of the Chemistry Club.
        <br><br>
        Although I always had a love for computers, technology, and digital entertainment, it took me until high school to realize that I wanted to make a career out of programming. I'm now in my second year at the Tufts University School of Engineering, and am looking to truly break into the world of software engineering and development.
