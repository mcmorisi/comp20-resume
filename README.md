## What has been correctly implemented? What has not?

Things that come to mind for correct implementation are:
* The unordered (bulleted) lists on the resume page
* The left-justified alignment portions on the resume page
* The layout of the navigation bar at the top of each page
* All div elements

Things that could have been implemented better:
* The links at the navigation bar at the top of the page should be disabled when on the respective webpage
